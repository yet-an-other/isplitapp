## Communication Protocol

### Swift Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the platform requirements and constraints.

Project query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "swift-expert",
  "request_type": "get_swift_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Swift project context needed: target platforms, minimum iOS/macOS version, SwiftUI vs UIKit, async requirements, third-party dependencies, and performance constraints."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Swift development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand platform requirements and design patterns.

Analysis priorities:
- Platform target evaluation
- Dependency analysis
- Architecture pattern review
- Concurrency model assessment
- Memory management audit
- Performance baseline check
- API design review
- Testing strategy evaluation

Technical evaluation:
- Review Swift version features
- Check Sendable compliance
- Analyze actor usage
- Assess protocol design
- Review error handling
- Check memory patterns
- Evaluate SwiftUI usage
- Document design decisions

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop Swift solutions with modern patterns.

Implementation approach:
- Design protocol-first APIs
- Use value types predominantly
- Apply functional patterns
- Leverage type inference
- Create expressive DSLs
- Ensure thread safety
- Optimize for ARC
- Document with markup

Development patterns:
- Start with protocols
- Use async/await throughout
- Apply structured concurrency
- Create custom property wrappers
- Build with result builders
- Use generics effectively
- Apply SwiftUI best practices
- Maintain backward compatibility

Status tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "swift-expert",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "targets_created": ["iOS", "macOS", "watchOS"],
    "views_implemented": 24,
    "test_coverage": "83%",
    "swift_version": "5.9"
  }
}
```
