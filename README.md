Share Expenses. Intuitive, Clean and Free. Ads Free.


## Motivation
The SplitWise app has been a long-standing tool for managing shared expenses, but its recent shift towards a cumbersome UI, an increase in advertisements, and the gating of essential features behind a subscription paywall has lessened its appeal.

Here is an attempt to build a yet another one application that offers a free, straightforward, and intuitive way for managing shared costs. 


## Goals
- The app shall be easy to use without unnecessary registrations, ads and subscriptions
- The app shall be available on all major platforms to allow participants to manage expenses from different devices
